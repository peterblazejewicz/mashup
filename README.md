# mashup
A mashup of pieces from larger libraries. Basically take bits of Bootstrap 3.*, Bootbox 4.* and mash them againts jQuery 1.4.4 to use in old, proprieptary software that supports jQuery 1.4.4 (custom built version).

Don't use it - use modern bits from original libraries. Written purposely to support old soft :mask:
