# mashup
A mashup of pieces from larger libraries. Basically takes bits of Bootstrap 3.*, Bootbox 4.* and mashes them against jQuery 1.4.4 to use in old, proprietary software which supports `oldie` jQuery 1.4.4 (custom built version).

Featured:

- custom version of `transition.js` from Bootstrap
- custom version of `modal.js` from Bootstrap
- custom version of `bootbox.js` from Bootbox
- custom CSS theme based custom Less build from Bootstrap
- minified/concatenated JS for easier deployment

The CSS theme is ready for a further customization (which is something to be done outside of Github according to legacy software CSS styles).

Final note: don't use it - use modern bits from original libraries. Written purposely to support old software elsewhere :mask:
